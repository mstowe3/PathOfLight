        <h2>Yoga Classes</h2>

        <h3><strong>Gentle Hatha Yoga</strong></h3>

        <p>Intended for beginners and anyone wishing a grounded foundation in the practice of yoga, this<br>
            60 minute class of poses and slow movement focuses on asana (proper alignment and posture),<br>
            pranayama (breath work), and guided meditation to foster your mind and body connection.</p>

        <h3><strong>Vinyasa Yoga</strong></h3>

        <p>Although designed for intermediate to advanced students, beginners are welcome to sample this<br>
            60 minute class that focuses on breath-synchronized movement -- you will inhale and exhale as<br>
            you flow energetically through yoga poses.</p>

        <h3><strong>Restorative Yoga</strong></h3>

        <p>This 90 minute class features very slow movement and long poses that are supported by a chair<br>
            or wall. This calming, restorative experience is suitable for students of any level of experience. <br>
            you flow energetically through yoga poses.</p>

        <h2>Relax Anytime with Savasana</h2>

        <p>Prepare yourself for savasana. Lie down on your yoga mat with your arms at your side with palms<br>
            up. Close your eyes and breathe slowly but deeply. Sink into the mat and let your worries slip away.<br>
            When you are ready, roll on your side and use your arms to push yourself to a sitting position with<br>
            crossed legs. Place your hands in a prayer position. Be grateful for all that you have in life.<br>
            Namaste.</p>
